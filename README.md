# Artificial_Neural_Network
Visualize efficiency of ANN in predicting a value.
Here an ANN is build using keras.
Dataset contains various details of customers of a bank and we are predicting where he/she wil leave the bank or not.
We applied binary_crossentropy to get the loss as we are predicting only for 1 value.
By training the network, we get an accuracy of 85.75% on the validation set.
